# Staking App

This is just a research excercise, but hopefully it'll be fruitful.

## Goals

- A primitive staking app that can be used in the ACL to govern other things in Aragon
- Be flexible enough to implement token-curated registries with the voting app and the [registry app](https://github.com/aragonlabs/registry)
- Identify potential issues with current aragonOS architecture for apps that require "fallback" transactions, i.e. transactions when something *does not occur*.
